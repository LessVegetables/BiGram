# BiGram
Project Class 25-26 • Week 1

This is the backend of the quick demo of my [n-gram project](https://github.com/LessVegetables/BiGram/).

The only changes to this branch, compared to `main`:
1. `main.py` — all of the telegram bot and database 
2. `ratings.db` — the database of ratins of the generated n-grams

## Note
This project has many flaws: from storing pending messages (the way that it's implemented and potentially the concept), to everything being in one single messy module. If you wanted something that goes against best practices — well then this is it :)

The scope of this bot is to be a simple and quick demo of the bigram that I can showcase to family/friends/teachers etc — not a produciton ready bot by any means lol.
